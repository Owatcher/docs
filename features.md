### Features based on Kano model

1. Must-haves: These are features that customers expect to be included in an APM platform. Examples of must-have features include:
- Real-time monitoring of application performance, including response times, error rates, and resource utilization
- Alerting and notification capabilities to ensure that issues are addressed in a timely manner
- Support for a wide range of application types and programming languages, to meet the needs of different customers
- Easy setup and integration with existing tools and infrastructure

2. Performance features: These are features that improve the performance of an APM platform, but are not necessarily expected by customers. Examples of performance features include:
- Advanced analytics and machine learning capabilities, which can provide deeper insights into application performance and identify optimization opportunities
- Integration with other monitoring and management tools, to provide a more complete view of the application ecosystem
- Customizable dashboards and reports, to allow customers to view and analyze data in a way that meets their specific needs
- Integration with DevOps tools and processes, to enable continuous improvement of application performance

3. Delighters: These are features that go above and beyond customer expectations, providing an exceptional experience. Examples of delighter features include:
- Predictive analytics and proactive issue resolution, which can help customers address issues before they impact users
- Automated root cause analysis, which can save time and effort in troubleshooting and resolving issues
- Personalized support and training, which can help customers get the most out of the APM platform and improve their overall application performance
- Gamification and rewards, which can create a fun and engaging experience for customers and encourage them to use the APM platform more often.

Overall, an APM platform based on the Kano model should prioritize must-have features, focus on improving performance features, and aim to include delighters to create an exceptional customer experience.
